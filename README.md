## Problem: Generate PLTR stock forecast for next 2 years

### Flask Application Design

The Flask application will consist of two main components: HTML files and routes.

**HTML Files:**
- **index.html:** This file will serve as the landing page of the application. It will contain a form for the user to enter the ticker symbol for the stock they want to forecast (in this case, PLTR).
- **forecast.html:** This file will display the forecast for the stock. It will include a chart showing the predicted stock prices over the next two years.

**Routes:**
- **/:** This route will handle the GET request for the landing page. It will render the index.html file.
- **predict/:** This route will handle the POST request to generate the forecast for the given stock ticker symbol. It will take the ticker symbol as an argument and use a machine learning model to predict future prices. The forecast will then be displayed in forecast.html.

### Implementation Notes
- The Flask app can be created using the `Flask` class and the routes can be defined using the `route` decorator.
- The HTML files can be created using a text editor or an HTML template engine.
- The machine learning model for stock price prediction can be trained using historical data and appropriate algorithms.
- The predicted stock prices can be displayed on a chart using a third-party library such as Plotly or Matplotlib.
